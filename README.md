# Functions and Errors
# VotingSystem
# Description 
The Voting smart contract provides functionality for voter registration, voting, and retrieving vote counts for candidates. Error handling is implemented using require, revert, and assert to ensure the contract behaves correctly and securely.The smart contract ensures that only registered voters can cast votes and handles various edge cases to maintain the integrity of the voting process.
