# Functions and Errors
# VotingSystem
# Description 
The Voting smart contract provides functionality for voter registration, voting, and retrieving vote counts for candidates. Error handling is implemented using require, revert, and assert to ensure the contract behaves correctly and securely.The smart contract ensures that only registered voters can cast votes and handles various edge cases to maintain the integrity of the voting process.
# Execution

Further steps,

- Create a file named VoteIntegrity.sol and  write code into it and after that compile it.
- After compiling the file proceed  to the deploy section and deploy it.
- Now we can see that vote, votes, register voter and voters are visible there.
- several statements like require, revert, and assert are used to verify that the voting requirements are met.
